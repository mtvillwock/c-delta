# Reflection

## What I liked

The `README.md` was well-structured, with only a few unclear parts.

## What I didn't like

The time expectations seemed misaligned with the amount of work being asked for in the prompt.

## Code Improvements

Would probably approach the `normalized_score` using the `CreativeQuality` model as an entry point instead of the `Response` model, as well as pulling out the math functionality into a separate object.
